**Hola @all**, that's me but before you ask more, some pertinent questions very succinctly answered.

# Who am I?
Just another developer who is also an aspiring entrepreneur and researcher. Most of the work I have undertaken can broadly fall in the domain of Information Communication and Technology for Development **(ICTD)**. I believe technology when used(_designed and deployed_) appropriately can result in positive societal change and even development in due course. I not only want to work towards designing such novel systems but also want to continue my efforts in order to understand what the are the preconditions which are essential to create an ecosystem for technology adoption and use.
