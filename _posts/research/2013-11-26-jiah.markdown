## Background
One of the largest challenges that continue to cripple the developing
world is lack of trained physicians. Even though there is no scarcity
of semi-trained labor force, many health workers in many developing
countries are not able to provide satisfactory care because of not having
enough proficiency. Developing countries like India also are also
weighed down with the load of infectious and chronic diseases that
usually have a quite expensive treatment. It is crucial that focus of the
solution to the aforementioned problem is shifted towards prevention
This can be compensated by appropriate screening of patients by partially trained
health workers. 

## Concept
We developed Jiah, a Java based mobile phone application, that
can be used to assist and connect health workers and trained medical professionals
through a backend Medical Record System (we use OpenMRS at the backend).
Jiah is an extension of Sana, a similar application currently available for android
phones, and was developed to cater to the majority of Java based phones currently
available in developing countries. Using XForms for creating our mobile
application provides the system users with the flexibility to create a wide variety
of forms with ease. We also performed a pilot study using Jiah.
