## Background
Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS) applications rely on physical sensor
data collected by mobile devices of a large number of participants.
Participating devices are required to execute sensing tasks with
certain requirements such as geographical location or data quality.
Often, it is sufficient to execute the tasks on a subset of devices
to avoid data redundancy and improve energy efficiency. Since
mobile devices are resource-constrained, it becomes important to
ensure a load-balanced allocation of sensing tasks to this subset
of participants, which will eventually ensure longer lifetimes of
devices and therefore, higher task service rates.
To take into account the resource-constrained nature of participants,
we consider the dynamic parameters of participants (such
as battery level and link speed) and their static parameters (such
as sensor power rates and the number of sensors available) to propose
a load-balanced task allocation algorithm for MCS systems.
Our algorithm is based on the model of device ‘richness’ which is
a measure of their available parameter levels. Based on the richness,
we propose two variants of our algorithm - greedy allocation,
and weighted-random allocation. We compare our algorithms with
three baseline approaches using simulations. Using a quantitative
measure of inequality distribution - Gini coefficient - we show that
our algorithm achieves perfect load balancing when the participants
have homogeneous configurations. Further, using our approach,
we are able to improve the lifetime of the system by approx. X%
which eventually results in a Y% improvement in the task service
rate.

## Contributions
1. We propose a model to evaluate the richness of devices in
terms of their capabilities (resource levels). Our model is inspired
by the Linux-based Completely Fair Scheduler
(CFS) which ensures fair allocation of CPU time to processes
based on their priorities.
2. We propose two variants, NV-Greedy and NV-Weighted,
of the load-balanced task allocation algorithm based on
our device richness model and compare their performance
with three baseline algorithms - Random, RoundRobin,
and MinAST , using extensive simulations.
3. We objectively evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm
using a quantitative measure - Gini coefficient . Gini
coefficient is commonly used in the field of economics to
measure the inequalities in income distribution of nature.
We use it to measure the inequalities in the distribution of
richness levels of devices.

## Results
Our results show that the proposed
variants improve the fairness in task allocation by upto 2-3%, which
results in an additional availability of upto 665 minutes of devices
with the system while improving the location accuracy of collected
sensor data. This is a significant gain which will increase with
the increase in number of devices available with the crowdsensing
system.
